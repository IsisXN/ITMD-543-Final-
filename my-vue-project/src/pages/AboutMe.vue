    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Hi my name is <strong>Isis Navarro</strong>. I’m passionate about photography, creative expression, and building community through the arts. 
      I’ve been part of the Photography Club at IIT for three years serving as public relations chair for two years. 
      This year, I’m proud to serve as President of the club. And help create a welcoming environment for students to share their artistry. 
      One of my biggest accomplishments was establishing a partnership between our club and Career Services, giving student photographers more visibility and professional opportunities. 
      Alongside photography, I’ve also gained valuable instructional experience as a Teaching Assistant, where I developed strong communication, leadership, and student support skills.
